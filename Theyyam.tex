\section{Definition}
  \label{sec:Definition}

Theyyam (after Skt. \textit{daiva} "deity") is an elaborate tantric, tribal-Hindu and shamanic ritual, to have divinities descend through oracles in trance who get possessed by divine spirits, found in the northern Malabar region of south-west India consisting of districts in northern Kerala and southern Karnataka. It is performed mostly by low-caste Dalit androgynous males with hereditory ritual roles and predominantly involves theatrical performances, including animal sacrifices for Cāmuṇḍā, typically held in sacred groves called \textit{kavus} or temple courtyards. Theyyam practitioners go into shamanic trance often with the aid of alchoholic beverage made of fermented coconuts called \textit{toddy} offered to them. They also play vital socio-shamanic roles such as providing healings and blessings in a given community hosting the ritual. Theyyam's ritual art forms across northern Malabar are highly diverse with presence of countlessly various deities derived from both Hindu Purāṇic and local non-Hindu mythologies. Although Theyyam is practised in Hindu context, its notable tribal and shamanic elements are considered to reflect its pre-Hindu or even pre-historic prototypes as seen in the theyyam of Gulykan, worshipped as Shiva, of tribal and shamanic nature, characteristically empolying tribal garments made of tender leaves of coconuts and oblong shamanic masks.

  \label{sec:Description}
  
The form of Theyyam (thirra) practised in the Panakkatan Malayan \Kavu\ located in Eranholi of Kannur district in Kerala begins with ritual offerings and blessings where live deities in their preliminary forms sanctify the space as well as those attending the ceremony.
The deities then perform three velattams, invoking \camunda\ through drumming, dance, and anointing the different alters in the \kavu.

forms, after which a new cast of dancers dressed in young palm leaves make offerings and receive garlands while the first deities watch from some ways away.
After the dance is complete, preparations are made for the first sacrifice of a live rooster where \camunda\ presents herself, dancing while hiding her face before devouring a live rooster, drinking its blood.
Having finished her meal of rooster and puffed rice, the possessed dancer crawls away in a trance, occasionally collapsing and writhing on the ground. 
A new troop of drummers is called on, as another rooster sacrifice takes place before the final morning fire dance, circumambulating the kava.
The crowd then disperses to reconvene in the afternoon for a final rooster sacrifice and ritual performances, finishing in the early evening.
